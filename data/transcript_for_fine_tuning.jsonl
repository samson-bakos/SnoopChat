{"prompt": "Relax.\n", "completion": "Wait."}
{"prompt": "I'm a G now, right?\n", "completion": "You a double O-G."}
{"prompt": "Next on LARRY KING LIVE.\n", "completion": "It's me and my new record. This is my fifth solo record, I might add. I just went in and just made a record that felt good to me, that was, you know, more about me just having a good time and putting people in the spirit of just enjoying some good music."}
{"prompt": "But malice implies bad?\n", "completion": "Yes, because in the beginning of this record, I had a lot of malice in my heart. And I was kind of frustrated and upset with the whole industry. And then, toward the end of this record, I found myself being in a place called Wonderland. That's why the record is called \"Malice in Wonderland,\" because I finally made it to happiness."}
{"prompt": "What changed?\n", "completion": "I think just, you know, my family being around me and just me en -- enjoying the fact that people still want to listen to me, from -- from being, you know, of working in 1992 to still being here and people still loving my music."}
{"prompt": "All right. The latest single, \"I Wanna Rock,\" generated some huge buzz, we understand.\n", "completion": "I mean, this was a big record for me because it -- it actually opened the door again and showed that the West Coast is clearly here to stay. And then, at the same time, this is a great record because it makes people understand that hip-hop is a great thing and it's universal and it's bicoastal."}
{"prompt": "When rap first started, a lot of people put it down.\n", "completion": "I believe that rap is the most important form of music right now, because it's the -- it's the -- it's the change and the choice of the new generation. Because if you notice, any sports venue or anything that has to do with entertainment, they always have to involve rap, because rap is the number one source of music right now."}
{"prompt": "But is it music?\n", "completion": "Yes, you can hum it if you -- if you do -- if you dealing with Snoop Dogg, you know what I'm saying?"}
{"prompt": "I'm a G now, right?\n", "completion": "You're a double O-G."}
{"prompt": "I'm a double G. You're going to learn that later, how I became a double G -- a new -- a new thing.\n", "completion": "I mean it was special, Larry, for them to even call me and have me in the room with all of those great singers. It was special because, you know, I was a kid watching it 25 years ago, seeing Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie and Ray Charles and all of the great musicians, you know, put a song together that meant so much. And for them to have me come be a part of the anniversary, it felt good to me."}
{"prompt": "Well, we've got a little toss here. The Bikini Glove Bling Bling Girls certainly weren't going anywhere during the making of Snoop's first single, \"Gangsta Luv.\" And we were there.\n", "completion": "Ooh-wee."}
{"prompt": "We'll talk about it more later.\n", "completion": "I've always had an infatuation with cars, especially old school cars, anything out of the '60s, '70s, '50s, '40s, '30s. I just liked it when cars were being made at the highest level, you understand?"}
{"prompt": "They were better then?\n", "completion": "Yes, they were way better. And they just mean a lot more to me to have an antique car."}
{"prompt": "Do you have many?\n", "completion": "I have 25 cars, Larry."}
{"prompt": "Where do you keep them?\n", "completion": "I've got a little space, I call the Doggy Dizey (ph) in the front of the Kezetin (ph), you know what I'm saying?"}
{"prompt": "Where do you keep them?\n", "completion": "I've got a little space out like the Bat Cave. You know how Batman got the little underground cave where he come out with his little whoo-whop (ph) when he need to?"}
{"prompt": "Snoop Dogg, I'm -- I must be going crazy. I'm beginning to understand you.\n", "completion": "I love that."}
{"prompt": "Did you invent this language?\n", "completion": "No. I believe it's something that's, you know, hereditary. I believe it's something that's, you know, accustomed to us from where we come from. It's a ghetto thing. You know, we have our own little slang that we use in the ghetto and it becomes our own language and our own lingo."}
{"prompt": "Where did you grow up?\n", "completion": "East Side, Long Beach."}
{"prompt": "Is that a tough area?\n", "completion": "It was tough, but it was fun. It was a great experience for me. I learned a lot, you know what I'm saying?"}
{"prompt": "Don't try, son, do it. And burn some incense as well.\n", "completion": "Turn that shit (EXPLETIVE LANGUAGE) back on, 'cuz."}
{"prompt": "It sounds nice.\n", "completion": "It's (EXPLETIVE LANGUAGE)."}
{"prompt": "Like your Lincoln.\n", "completion": "It's a '76. It would be out 'til next year. But I know some people that know some people that robbed some people."}
{"prompt": "Yes?\n", "completion": "This little meeting, it never happened."}
{"prompt": "You've got some big stars working with you.\n", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Snoop Dogg is our guest.\n", "completion": "It's about a musical experience through the mind of Snoop Dogg. And it's supported by my movie, \"Malice in Wonderland,\" where I play a super hero named Malice who's trying to clean up a community called Wonderland, where he lives at, and overthrow a dictator named Cain."}
{"prompt": "Wonderland.\n", "completion": "I greatly appreciate you guys for coming out tonight. Wonderland, right now, is in desperate need for us to become one. Everybody know that me and Cain got a thing. I don't like him, he don't like me. I've come to find out that it's about all of us becoming one, to unite, to fight against that man called Cain. We'll become untouchable."}
{"prompt": "Snoop, we had a tough time taking clips out of there for a -- you know, a family show.\n", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "Why are you so gritty?\n", "completion": "I mean, it's needed sometimes. You know, I do have family time. I had a family show that I had on the air for two years called \"Fatherhood\" with my wife and my beautiful kids. So I do find time to give up a little family time."}
{"prompt": "Yes, it's -- in other words, that's -- you've got to do what you've got to do.\n", "completion": "I've got to give them what they want."}
{"prompt": "Because the last time you were on, you showed a wholesome side, a family life, as you said, the husband who reconciled with the wife. Much of this was shown to the world.\n", "completion": "I believe the show was too positive and too enlightening. I think people..."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute...\n", "completion": "Yes, I mean and they expect..."}
{"prompt": "Too positive, too enlightening, too good, too wholesome, too (INAUDIBLE)?\n", "completion": "Yes. Yes. Because they wanted some drama. You know, you've got -- you've got to understand, I'm Snoop Dogg. So you want confusion and you want, you know, disruption. And my house is not like that. My wife does a great job of running my house and my kids are in line. So it's a beautiful situation."}
{"prompt": "How is the reconciliation working?\n", "completion": "Oh, it's beautiful. We've been on the right track. Really, we don't look back no more. We're all about moving ahead."}
{"prompt": "How long were you apart?\n", "completion": "About six months."}
{"prompt": "But if you look at all these videos and stuff, you look like a player.\n", "completion": "Yes, because that's -- that's who I am when I'm playing that role, you understand me?"}
{"prompt": "You -- you've been -- you've admitted your own infidelity at times, right?\n", "completion": "Yes, I have."}
{"prompt": "What do you make of Tiger Woods?\n", "completion": "I make, you know, nothing of it. You know, that's a proximal issue with him and his wife. And I feel like it's been blown out of proportion because he was looked at as, you know, somebody who was perfect."}
{"prompt": "Do you think he's going to do good in the Masters?\n", "completion": "I think he's going to do real good -- real well in the Masters and he's going to do real good in life, you know, just getting his life back right and understanding what's important, because sometimes it takes a negative situation like that for you to really turn it into a positive."}
{"prompt": "Yes. It takes a down to get up.\n", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Do you -- do you think the temptations of Hollywood and the music industry are worse now?\n", "completion": "Definitely, because there are -- there are so many ways to -- to have access to them, even if you're not in Hollywood. It's like that computer game is so -- so crazy now. It's so exposed, everybody knows everything now."}
{"prompt": "Any -- any downs, by the way, the hood and Hollywood?\n", "completion": "Well, I call it Hollyhood."}
{"prompt": "What's your name -- your real name?\n", "completion": "My real name is Cordozar Calvin Broadus."}
{"prompt": "Cordozar?\n", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "How did you come up with Snoop Dogg?\n", "completion": "My mother started calling me it..."}
{"prompt": "From Peanuts?\n", "completion": "Yes, I used to watch \"Charlie Brown\" and there was a character on there I used to always imitate."}
{"prompt": "Snoopy?\n", "completion": "Yes, the dog."}
{"prompt": "That's still a great cartoon.\n", "completion": "It really is."}
{"prompt": "He's gone. There's never been anything like \"Peanuts\".\n", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "What do -- what do you think about Obama?\n", "completion": "I think he's doing a great job, you know, considering all the pressure that he was up against, you know, taking over a bad situation in the beginning and trying to clean up and -- and move forward and get us back on the right pace."}
{"prompt": "I feel like I'm being controlled by my GPS. I'm turning right as instructed.\n", "completion": "Make another right in 40 yards."}
{"prompt": "I'm sneaking deftly into the right hand lane.\n", "completion": "Proceed east and turn right in 40 yards."}
{"prompt": "This machine is good. OK, I am now turning right.\n", "completion": "Proceed south and turn right in 40 yards."}
{"prompt": "Because I had to turn right.\n", "completion": "Didn't I tell you to turn left?"}
{"prompt": "This still drives like new?\n", "completion": "It drives good. It rides like an airplane. It's a real smooth, slow motion (INAUDIBLE)."}
{"prompt": "Now, when you have us sitting in it, we're -- we're going to go up and down bouncing (INAUDIBLE)?\n", "completion": "Yes (INAUDIBLE)..."}
{"prompt": "For what purpose do you have that?\n", "completion": "That's called a low ride. That's called hitting the switch. That's dippin', you understand me?"}
{"prompt": "My car don't dip.\n", "completion": "I'm going to show you how to dip, Larry."}
{"prompt": "All right. Let's do this.\n", "completion": "Don't worry about nothing. Let's get it in. Yes, dip it."}
{"prompt": "What was your model number?\n", "completion": "1967 Pontiac Parisienne."}
{"prompt": "I never heard of a Parisienne.\n", "completion": "Yes. It's low to the floor, too."}
{"prompt": "Whoa.\n", "completion": "See?"}
{"prompt": "I'm low to the floor. Whoa.\n", "completion": "You need some of this here."}
{"prompt": "Here we go into Snoopville.\n", "completion": "This is the magic."}
{"prompt": "I'm still on the brake.\n", "completion": "That's me hitting the switch, baby."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you're controlling the gas?\n", "completion": "That's me controlling it."}
{"prompt": "Now, by the way, if you want to have Snoop do your GPS, all you've got to do is go to VoiceSkins.com, right, and bring it down?\n", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "VoiceSkins.com and Snoop can drive you home.\n", "completion": "Lada (ph)."}
{"prompt": "Lada.\n", "completion": "Well, you know, Larry, I just had to tell myself one day, I have to be real creative and different than everybody. You know, I was looking at -- at the cars and I was riding in my car, hearing this lady tell me where to go everyday, getting tired of hearing her voice. I said, man, it would be real cool if I were doing this. So I reached out to the people from TomTom Club and GPS and whatnot and we made it happen."}
{"prompt": "But you don't get mad?\n", "completion": "I mean that's how you would do it, Larry, because, you know, you've got that kind of attitude. Me personally, I'm too cool to get mad."}
{"prompt": "No, what -- a guy -- I tell the guy to make a left, he makes a right, he misses his turn. I don't want to do that to him anymore.\n", "completion": "Yes (INAUDIBLE)."}
{"prompt": "I get mad.\n", "completion": "I've got you."}
{"prompt": "All right, I get it.\n", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "The Top Ten Things That Sound Cool When Said by Snoop Dogg.\n", "completion": "Yo."}

{"prompt": "What did you make of that whole Letterman-Leno thing?\n", "completion": "Oh..."}
{"prompt": "(INAUDIBLE)?\n", "completion": "I think it was a -- I think they all cool with each other. They all friends. It was like some made up, scripted feud. KING: You didn't buy it?"}
{"prompt": "Snoop. How skeptical you are.\n", "completion": "That didn't seem like a real feud to me. Nobody hit nobody, nobody got violent."}
{"prompt": "Oh, now you're going back to the hood.\n", "completion": "Yes, exactly."}
{"prompt": "Right?\n", "completion": "I mean that's where I'm from."}

And we're just doing so many great things in the inner city right now, it's a beautiful feeling to be a part of it."}
{"prompt": "Flag or tackle?\n", "completion": "Oh, it's tackle. It starts off as flag at age six and then they work their way up to the age of 13 to play tackle."}
{"prompt": "Can anybody around there lay play?\n", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Or do you have to live within a certain neighborhood?\n", "completion": "No, you can live -- all over LA, South Central, Compton, Long Beach, Pomona. All you've got to do is hit us up at SnoopYouthFootballLeague.com and get at Commissioner Wadu."}
{"prompt": "How about a couple of white kids from Beverly Hills?\n", "completion": "Why not, not why?"}
{"prompt": "Because I've got two pretty good ones.\n", "completion": "Come on, let's play."}
{"prompt": "I mean what if they were to win the Snooperbowl?\n", "completion": "No, that would make me feel good, because football has no color barriers."}
{"prompt": "You've got 3,500 kids in the league.\n", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "How did you start that?\n", "completion": "Well, I started it six years ago with my oldest son, you know, Corde. He was playing Little League football. And we were playing in a league that I didn't feel that was really, you know -- really meeting the needs of what we needed as far as an inner city football program."}
{"prompt": "You're a good guy.\n", "completion": "Thank you, Larry."}

My musical influences growing up were George Clinton, Curtis Mayfield, Earth, Wind & Fire."}
{"prompt": "Spinning wheel...\n", "completion": "Get it, Larry."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I love that. I love that. You know, Earth, Wind & Fire were pretty good.\n", "completion": "Yes, they were."}
{"prompt": "I think that's funny.\n", "completion": "I've got a thing called Ustream TV and I have my own show called \"The Wake & Bake Show,\" where they can actually look and see me personally. And then I hit them on Twitter through my conversation, because it's kind of hard for me to be trying to type all of my fans at one time. So what I do is I take the messages along the side and I talk with them and they have a chance to ride with me and roll with me while I'm playing great music and letting them be a part of this Snoop Dogg thing."}
{"prompt": "You're very involved with your fans, right?\n", "completion": "I'm a..."}

Everything that I do is always about trying to get to the next level, whether it's financially, spiritually or just mentally, you understand?"}
{"prompt": "Is that sweat suit part of your clothing line?\n", "completion": "Yes. I'm down with Adidas. That's who I represent now, you know what I'm saying?"}
{"prompt": "And why the green, blue and yellow?\n", "completion": "Because it's a beautiful color. It's like that Bob Marley feeling. Sometimes I feel like I'm Bob Marley reincarnated and it's got that Jamaican feel on it."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to make you like me even more. I knew Bob Marley.\n", "completion": "You did?"}
{"prompt": "I interviewed him.\n", "completion": "Man, I really wanted to meet him. That's one person that they always said that's somebody that you can work with and that ain't here right now..."}

{"prompt": "In other words, you rehearsed it pretty good?\n", "completion": "It wasn't no rehearsal to this here, Larry. Don't let the smooth taste fool you."}
{"prompt": "You went into a wrestling ring without rehearsal?\n", "completion": "Yes. With no rehearsal. This is what I do."}

{"prompt": "Did you remember that or read off a prompter?\n", "completion": "That was off the top of my head. Come on, Larry. You know how I do it."}
{"prompt": "You're a well known pot smoker.\n", "completion": "I wouldn't say that. I would say that I'm a stoner."}
{"prompt": "You are aware that that is illegal, sir. You are breaking the law. You are a criminal. You are a criminal.\n", "completion": "No, I actually am under the influence of medical marijuana. Actually, a doctor prescribed --"}

{"prompt": "Well, how about learning, maybe you'll be better without it?\n", "completion": "Let's try that one time."}
{"prompt": "Try it one time, Snoop. \n", "completion": "We'll do it together."}

{"prompt": "No, but Snoop Dogg, I assume, is a --\n", "completion": "Oh, you mean why did I change that?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.\n", "completion": "Oh, that's the name that I was always called as a kid. My mother never called me by my real name. I never heard my real name unless I was at school. So, you know, the name that I was accustomed to was Snoop at home, or Snoopy or Snoop."}
{"prompt": "Who came -- how did they come up with Cordozar?\n", "completion": "My mother came up with that name."}
